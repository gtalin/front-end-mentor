## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)


### What I learned

Learned how to setup tailwind css for an HTML project. Took some time getting used to the utilities first approach. But so far enjoying it quite a lot.

### Continued development

Would like to do more projetcs using tailwindcss. I have also done several other front end mentor design implementations which I would like to get deployed. Would also like to redo some of those projects using Tailwind css.

### Useful resources

- [Tailwind docs](https://tailwindcss.com/) - This helped me quickly search tailwind css properties.
- [Net Ninja tailwind css](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9gpXORlEHjc5bgnIi5HEGhw) - This helped me get an HTML based tailwind css project up and running. Also helped me get acquanited with a lot of tailwind css classes in a project based setting.
- [Tailwind CSS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCxcTsOHrjo&t=360s) - This course was particularly useful for getting a custom theme set up. Though tailwind has a lot of custom colors, most projects need their own colors and fonts setup.
- [Tailwind labs](https://www.youtube.com/tailwindlabs) - A lot of videos in here helped with grasping the utilities first approach. Before watching these videos I did not realise how convenient it was to never have to leave HTML while implementing the design.
